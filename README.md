# Abstract
Encryption is a process to protect the data by means of an encryption associated with a key so that the information is not visible, this with the aim of protecting the information of third parties that are not authorized to view it, for this we use a symmetric encryption algorithm called Hill Cipher (HC). The HC algorithm fits perfectly to the resolution of the problem since it is used with an N * N matrix to encrypt the data of a file.

- This kind of encryption can help people to share evidence of corruption without the risk of the message being intercepted.
- Can help you to keep your nudes safe.
- Only the person with the key can view the content of the file.

This a project I have been working during my studies at the university, here is the article:

# New Features!

  - Now you can encrypt any kind of file, no matter the format.
  - Created a parallel version for the use of tegra devices with CUDA.
# Details:
- Works incredibly fast using "Unified Memory" in Nvidia Jetson devices.
- It is an artisan work since I programmed it with standard libraries. You should not have problems with compilation and dependencies.
- Using the power of C++ and C to provide a very fast program with very low memory consumption.
- It creates a shared library so you can include Tochcrypt to your other programs.

#### Building for source
First clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mroctavious/Tochcrypt.git
```

For production release under any Linux distro. This command will create executable(***Tochcrypt***) and also a shared library called libtochcrypt.so in the PREFIX folder(Default:/usr/local):
```sh
$ sudo make install
```

To create the program using the power of Nvidia GPUs with CUDA. This command will create executable(***Tochcrypt***) in the current folder
```sh
$ make cuda
```

To create the program under OSX. This command will create executable(***Tochcrypt***) in the current folder
```sh
$ make osx
```

### Using the software
When you compile the source code it will generate an executable program called ***Tochcrypt***.
```sh
$ Tochcrypt --help
```

### Encrypting

To encrypt a file just execute the following command, replacing "PATH/TO/FILE" with the path to your file to be encrypted and "PATH/TO/OUTPUT_NAME" with the name of the output generated.
The program will generate 2 output files:
- OUTPUT_NAME
  - Encrypted File
- OUTPUT_NAME.tochkey
  - Key file. This file is the "key" to open the encrypted file and read the original content
```sh
$ Tochcrypt -e PATH/TO/FILE -o PATH/TO/OUTPUT_NAME
```

### Decrypting
To restore the original file, it must go through a decryption process. To do this use the --decrypt(-d) and --key(-k) options, just execute the following command, replacing "PATH/TO/ENCRYPTED_FILE" with the path to your encrypted file, "PATH/TO/KEY_FILE" with the path to the key file(***.tochkey***) and "PATH/TO/OUTPUT_NAME" with the name of the output generated.
The program will generate 1 output file:
- OUTPUT_NAME
  - Decrypted file. It is the original file.
```sh
$ Tochcrypt -d PATH/TO/ENCRYPTED_FILE -k PATH/TO/KEY_FILE \ 
-o PATH/TO/OUTPUT_NAME
```
### Using the shared library


### Todos

 - Write version for GPUs not capable of using Unified Memory
 - Implement the proposed Gauss-Jacques method to obtain modular inverse matrices variable sized without a theoretical limit. This will allow us to create very big matrix keys, doing the processs unhackable using brute force.
